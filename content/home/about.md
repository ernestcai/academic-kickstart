# Biography
Hi, I'm currently an third-year undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University. During these years, I had several opportunities to join in a number of fascinating projects in the field of Computer Science, especially in Robotics. Hope you would enjoy viewing them same as I was working on them. Feel free to contact me with any question.
