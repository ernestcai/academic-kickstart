# Biography
Hi, I'm an third-year undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University. Currently I am working at ShanghaiTech Automation and Robotics Lab (STAR Lab), under the supervision of <a href="https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/people/soeren">Prof. SÃ¶ren Schwertfeger</a>. My primarily research interest focuses on SLAM and auto-navigation (including Computer Vision, Lidar, etc).<br>
<br>
During these years, I had several opportunities to join in a number of fascinating projects in the field of Computer Science, especially in Robotics. Hope you would enjoy viewing them same as when I was working on them. Feel free to contact me with any question.
