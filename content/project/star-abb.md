![ABB-STAR Joint Project](/img/star-abb-big.png)
With autonomous ground vehicle (ClearapthPath Husky) with a dual-arm manipulator (ABB Yumi), we can perform much more complex tasks. In this project, we are exploring what we can do when combining them. In the end, we successfully built a robot that can perform auto-navigation to press target button.<br>
In this project, I mainly focus on SLAM and auto-navigation.  <br>
For more details, please refer to the [project page](https://robotics.shanghaitech.edu.cn/node/204) @ STAR Lab , with cool demo video there :)
